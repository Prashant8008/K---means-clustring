🚀 Task 2 Completed: K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation! 🛍️

I'm excited to share my latest work with Prodigy Info Tech! This time, I've developed a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history. 🎯📊

By identifying distinct customer segments, the model enables better-targeted marketing strategies, personalized offers, and an enhanced shopping experience. It’s a step forward in leveraging data to drive business growth!

Looking forward to exploring more techniques in customer analytics!
